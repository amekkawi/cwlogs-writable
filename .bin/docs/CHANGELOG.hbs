# cwlogs-writable Change Log #

## 0.4.3 (Jun 19, 2017)

  * Add support for validating max message bytes
     * Add {{mdLink "CWLogsWritable#reduceOversizedMessage"}} method to allow custom
       handling of oversized messages to reduce their size.
     * Add {{mdLink "CWLogsWritable#event:oversizeLogEvent"}} event that is fired for
       messages that are dropped due to their size.
     * Change {{mdLink "CWLogsWritable#getMessageSize"}} to accurately measure the byte
       size if the estimate puts it over the max size.
     * Change {{mdLink "CWLogsWritable#dequeueNextLogBatch"}} to drop log events if:
        * getMessageSize returns a size for the message that is over the
          limit, and...
        * Passing the message through reduceOversizedMessage does not
          reduce the message to fit within the limit.
