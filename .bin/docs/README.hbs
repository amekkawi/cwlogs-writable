## Features ##

* Uses [aws-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-sdk).
* Can be used anywhere Writable streams are allowed.
* Allows for recovery from AWS errors.
* Creates log groups and streams if they do not exist.
* Filtering of log events by the stream itself.
* Safe stringification of log events.

## API Docs ##

There are two forms of the API docs:

* [Normal API docs](docs/api.md) - Use this if you using cwlogs-writable
  as-is and not customizing/extending it's functionality.
* [Extended API docs](docs/api-protected.md) - Use this to also view
  `protected` methods that you can use to customize/extend cwlogs-writable.

## Quick Start ##

Install the library using NPM into your existing node project:

```
npm install cwlogs-writable
```

Create and write to the stream.

```javascript
var CWLogsWritable = require('cwlogs-writable');

// Make stream name as unique as possible (see "Picking LogStream Names").
var streamName = 'my-log-stream/' + Date.now()
  + '/' + Math.round(Math.random() * 4026531839 + 268435456).toString(16);

var stream = new CWLogsWritable({
  logGroupName: 'my-aws-log-group',
  logStreamName: streamName,

  // Options passed to the AWS.CloudWatchLogs service.
  cloudWatchLogsOptions: {
    // Change the AWS region as needed.
    region: 'us-east-1',

    // Example authenticating using access key.
    accessKeyId: '{AWS-IAM-USER-ACCESS-KEY-ID}',
    secretAccessKey: '{AWS-SECRET-ACCESS-KEY}'
  }
});

stream.write('example-log-message');
```

Also consider this checklist:

* Are my log stream names [unique enough](#picking-logstream-names)?
* What if a log record [stringification fails](#capturing-log-record-stringification-errors)?
* Should my logging [recover from errors](#recovering-from-errors) or fail fast?

## Bunyan Example ##

```javascript
var bunyan = require('bunyan');
var CWLogsWritable = require('cwlogs-writable');

// Make stream name as unique as possible (see "Picking LogStream Names").
var streamName = 'my-log-stream/' + Date.now()
  + '/' + Math.round(Math.random() * 4026531839 + 268435456).toString(16);

var logger = bunyan.createLogger({
  name: 'foo',
  streams: [
    {
      level: 'debug',

      // If 'raw' the CloudWatch log event timestamp will
      // be taken from the bunyan JSON (i.e. rec.time).
      type: 'raw',

      stream: new CWLogsWritable({
        logGroupName: 'my-aws-log-group',
        logStreamName: streamName,
        cloudWatchLogsOptions: { /* ... */ }
      })
    }
  ]
});
```

## Picking LogStream Names ##

In AWS CloudWatch Logs a LogStream represents "a sequence of log events from a
single emitter of logs".

The important part is "single emitter", as this implies that log events should
not be put into a LogStream concurrently by multiple emitters.

This is enforced by the [PutLogEvents API action](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutLogEvents.html)
which requires each call to include a "sequenceToken". That token is changed
each time a call is successful, and the new token is used for the next call.

If an emitter provides an incorrect token, the API will respond with
an __InvalidSequenceTokenException__.

To avoid this error, you must pick LogStream names that are unique to the
emitter or at least include enough randomness.

```javascript
// Example generation of LogStream name
var logStreamName = [

  // Environment identifier (e.g. "production")
  process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development',

  // Current UTC date
  new Date().toISOString().substr(0, 10),

  // EC2 instance ID, optionally provided as an env variable
  process.env.EC2_INSTANCE_ID || null,

  // Process ID
  'p' + process.pid,

  // Random hex string (from "10000000" to "ffffffff")
  Math.round(Math.random() * 4026531839 + 268435456).toString(16),

].filter(Boolean).join('/').replace(/[:*]/g, '');
```

## Capturing Log Record Stringification Errors ##

Before log records are sent to AWS they must be stringified.
cwlogs-writable uses safe stringification techniques to handle
circular references that would normally cause JSON.stringify to fail.

Other errors thrown during stringification (e.g. one thrown by a
[property getter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get))
will also be handled if the optional dependency
[safe-json-stringify](https://npmjs.com/package/safe-json-stringify)
is installed.

If it is not installed, cwlogs-writable will catch the error and emit a
`stringifyError` event.

```javascript
var stream = new CWLogsWritable({ ... });

// Catch errors if safe-json-stringify is not installed
stream.on('stringifyError', function(err, record) {
  console.log('Failed to stringify log entry!', err);

  // You can attempt to manually process the record argument,
  // but be careful as you will may hit the same error.
  //customBadRecordProcessing(record);
});
```

## Recovering from Errors ##

By default cwlogs-writable will handle the two most common AWS errors,
`InvalidSequenceTokenException` and `DataAlreadyAcceptedException`, to
give your application as much resiliency as possible.

For all other errors, the default behavior of a CWLogsWritable stream is to
emit an 'error' event, clear any queued logs, and ignore all further writes to
the stream to prevent memory leaks.

To override this behavior you can provide a `onError` callback that will
allow you to recover from these errors.

```javascript
var CWLogsWritable = require('cwlogs-writable');

function onError(err, logEvents, next) {
  // Use built-in behavior if the error is not
  // from a PutLogEvents action (logEvents will be null).
  if (!logEvents) {
    next(err);
    return;
  }

  // Requeue the log events after a delay,
  // if the queue is small enough.
  if (this.getQueueSize() < 100) {
    setTimeout(function() {
      // Pass the logEvents to the "next" callback
      // so they are added back to the head of the queue.
      next(logEvents);
    }, 2000);
  }

  // Otherwise, log the events to the console
  // and resume streaming.
  else {
    console.error(
      'Failed to send logEvents: ' +
      JSON.stringify(logEvents)
    );

    next();
  }
}

// Make stream name as unique as possible (see "Picking LogStream Names").
var streamName = 'my-log-stream/' + Date.now()
  + '/' + Math.round(Math.random() * 4026531839 + 268435456).toString(16);

var stream = new CWLogsWritable({
  logGroupName: 'my-aws-log-group',
  logStreamName: streamName,
  cloudWatchLogsOptions: { /* ... */ },

  // Pass the onError callback to CWLogsWritable
  onError: onError
});
```

## Custom Handling of InvalidSequenceTokenException AWS Errors ##

Frequent `InvalidSequenceTokenException` AWS errors may indicate a
problem with the uniqueness of your LogStream name
(see [Picking LogStream Names](#picking-logstream-names)).

If you are experiencing throttling on
[PutLogEvents](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_PutLogEvents.html)
or [DescribeLogStreams](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatchLogs/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeLogStreams.html)
actions, you may want to add custom handling of `InvalidSequenceTokenException` errors.

```javascript
// Example of changing the logStreamName on
// InvalidSequenceTokenException errors
// to attempt to avoid further collisions.

function getLogStreamName() {
  return 'my-log-stream/' + Date.now()
    + '/' + Math.round(Math.random() * 4026531839 + 268435456).toString(16);
}

function onError(err, logEvents, next) {
  // Change the LogStream name to get a new
  // randomized value, and requeue the log events.
  if (err.code === 'InvalidSequenceTokenException') {
    this.logStreamName = getLogStreamName();
    next(logEvents);
  }

  // Default to built-in behavior.
  else {
    next(err);
  }
}

var stream = new CWLogsWritable({
  logGroupName: 'my-aws-log-group',
  logStreamName: getLogStreamName(),
  cloudWatchLogsOptions: { /* ... */ },

  // Disable the default handling of
  // InvalidSequenceTokenException errors
  // so onError will get them instead.
  retryOnInvalidSequenceToken: false,

  // Pass the onError callback to CWLogsWritable
  onError: onError
});
```
